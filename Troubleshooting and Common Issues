## Troubleshooting and Help with Setup Errors

This section provides solutions to common problems and errors you might encounter while setting up and running Anthropic's Computer Use Beta on your main display. If you're stuck, try these troubleshooting steps:

### "Timed out" Errors:

- **What happens:** You might see messages like  "timed out: bash has not returned in 120.0 seconds and must be restarted".
- **Why it happens:** The program might be trying to run commands too quickly or having trouble with background tasks. This can happen if your system is busy or if there are conflicts with other programs.
- **Possible Solution:**
    - **For advanced users:** If you're comfortable editing code, you can try modifying the `computer.py` file. Find the `stop()` method and make sure it includes a line to `await self._process.wait()`. This can help the program wait for commands to finish correctly.

### Scaling Issues

- **(Optional) Disable scaling:**
    - **What happens:**  The app might not display correctly, or elements might be the wrong size.
    - **Why:** Automatic scaling on your system can sometimes conflict with how the Beta app tries to use the display.
    - **How to fix it:**
        - Open the `computer.py` file.
        - Find the line that says `_scaling_enabled = True`
        - Change it to `_scaling_enabled = False`
    - **Note:** Disabling scaling might make things appear smaller or larger than usual. You can adjust your system's display settings to compensate.

### API Key Errors:

- **What happens:** The app might say your API key is invalid or missing.
- **Why:** You might have entered the key incorrectly, or it might not have the required permissions.
- **How to fix it:**
    - Double-check that you've entered your Anthropic API key correctly in the environment variables.
    - Make sure you've copied the key exactly, with no extra spaces or characters.
    - **Tip:** Copy and paste the key to avoid typos.
    - Verify that your API key has the necessary permissions to use the Computer Use Beta. You might need to contact Anthropic to enable these permissions.

### Virtual Environment Issues:

- **What happens:** You might get errors related to missing packages or modules.
- **Why:** The virtual environment might not be set up correctly, or the required packages might not be installed.
- **How to fix it:**
    - Make sure your virtual environment is activated by running `source .venv/bin/activate` in your terminal.
    - If you're still having trouble, try creating a new virtual environment and reinstalling the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Permission Problems:

- **What happens:** The app might not be able to access the display or perform certain actions.
- **Why:**  Running the app without `sudo` can prevent it from having the necessary permissions.
- **How to fix it:**
    - Run the Streamlit app with `sudo` using the command `sudo -E .venv/bin/python -m streamlit run computer_use_demo/streamlit.py`.
    - **Caution:** Using `sudo` grants elevated permissions, which can be risky. Make sure you understand the implications and use it with caution.

### General Troubleshooting:

- **Restart everything:** Sometimes a simple reboot of your computer can resolve unexpected issues.
- **Check your internet connection:** A stable internet connection is essential for the app to function correctly.
- **Update your system:** Make sure your Ubuntu system and packages are up-to-date using `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt upgrade`.
- **Search online:** If you encounter a specific error message, You might find helpful information on forums, Stack Overflow, or Anthropic's documentation.
